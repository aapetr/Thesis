   abstract = {Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) has become one of the most widely used methods to extract white matter (WM) fibre orientation information from diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) data, overcoming the crossing fibre limitations inherent in the diffusion tensor model. It is routinely used to obtain high quality fibre orientation distribution function (fODF) estimates and fibre tractograms and is increasingly used to obtain apparent fibre density (AFD) measures. Unfortunately, CSD typically only supports data acquired on a single shell in q-space. With multi-shell data becoming more and more prevalent, there is a growing need for CSD to fully support such data. Furthermore, CSD can only provide high quality fODF estimates in voxels containing WM only. In voxels containing other tissue types such as grey matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the WM response function may no longer be appropriate and spherical deconvolution produces unreliable, noisy fODF estimates.The aim of this study is to incorporate support for multi-shell data into the CSD approach as well as to exploit the unique b-value dependencies of the different tissue types to estimate a multi-tissue ODF. The resulting approach is dubbed multi-shell, multi-tissue CSD (MSMT-CSD) and is compared to the state-of-the-art single-shell, single-tissue CSD (SSST-CSD) approach. Using both simulations and real data, we show that MSMT-CSD can produce reliable WM/GM/CSF volume fraction maps, directly from the DW data, whereas SSST-CSD has a tendency to overestimate the WM volume in voxels containing GM and/or CSF. In addition, compared to SSST-CSD, MSMT-CSD can substantially increase the precision of the fODF fibre orientations and reduce the presence of spurious fODF peaks in voxels containing GM and/or CSF. Both effects translate into more reliable AFD measures and tractography results with MSMT-CSD compared to SSST-CSD.},

   abstract = {This chapter provides a very basic introduction to the concept of diffusion MRI as a probe of tissue microstructure. The concept of Gaussian diffusion is explored and the effect of diffusion on the MR signal is explained. This leads onto a discussion of how the apparent diffusion coefficient is estimated using MR methods. We then explore how tissue microstructure affects the random walk of water molecules undergoing diffusion and why, in highly ordered tissue, the single apparent diffusion coefficient model is inadequate for characterizing the diffusion process. This motivates the introduction of the diffusion tensor model. Basic requirements for collecting data suitable for estimating the tensor are discussed, together with a brief treatment on the estimation process. We then focus on the quantitative parameters that can be extracted from the tensor, including the mean diffusivity, various indices of diffusion anisotropy, and principal diffusion orientation-showing how the latter can be used to infer pathways in "fiber orientation maps." A brief discussion of the optimal design of the acquisition is included. Finally, we highlight some of the ways in which diffusion tensor imaging data can be corrupted and strategies aimed at ameliorating them. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {It has long been recognized that the diffusion tensor model is inappropriate to characterize complex fiber architecture, causing tensor-derived measures such as the primary eigenvector and fractional anisotropy to be unreliable or misleading in these regions. There is however still debate about the impact of this problem in practice. A recent study using a Bayesian automatic relevance detection (ARD) multicompartment model suggested that a third of white matter (WM) voxels contain crossing fibers, a value that, whilst already significant, is likely to be an underestimate. The aim of this study is to provide more robust estimates of the proportion of affected voxels, the number of fiber orientations within each WM voxel, and the impact on tensor-derived analyses, using large, high-quality diffusion-weighted data sets, with reconstruction parameters optimized specifically for this task. Two reconstruction algorithms were used: constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), and the ARD method used in the previous study. We estimate the proportion of WM voxels containing crossing fibers to be ~90% (using CSD) and 63% (using ARD). Both these values are much higher than previously reported, strongly suggesting that the diffusion tensor model is inadequate in the vast majority of WM regions. This has serious implications for downstream processing applications that depend on this model, particularly tractography, and the interpretation of anisotropy and radial/axial diffusivity measures. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {The diffusion properties from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are sensitive to white matter (WM) abnormalities and could serve as indicators of diffuse axonal damages incurred during a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Analyses of diffusion metrics in the regions of interest (ROIs) were used to compare the differences in the 18 major fiber tracts in 46 participants, between TBI participants with (n = 17) or without (n = 16) chronic symptoms (CS) and a control group (CG, n = 13). In addition to the widely used diffusion metrics, such as fractional anisotropy (FA), mean (MD), axial (AD) and radial (RD) diffusivities, apparent fiber density (AFD), complexity (CX) and fixel number (FN) derived from Mrtrix3 software package were used to characterize WM tracts and compare between participant groups in the ROIs defined by the fixel numbers. Significant differences were found in FA, AFD, MD, RD and CX in ROIs with different FNs in the corpus callosum forceps minor, left and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and left and right uncinate fasciculus for both TBI groups compared to controls. Diffusion properties in ROIs with different FNs can serve as detailed biomarkers of WM abnormalities, especially for individuals with chronic TBI related symptoms.},

   abstract = {Diffusion MRI has provided the neuroimaging community with a powerful tool to acquire in-vivo data sensitive to microstructural features of white matter, up to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than typical voxel sizes. The key to extracting such valuable information lies in complex modelling techniques, which form the link between the rich diffusion MRI data and various metrics related to the microstructural organization. Over time, increasingly advanced techniques have been developed, up to the point where some diffusion MRI models can now provide access to properties specific to individual fibre populations in each voxel in the presence of multiple “crossing” fibre pathways. While highly valuable, such fibre-specific information poses unique challenges for typical image processing pipelines and statistical analysis. In this work, we review the “Fixel-Based Analysis” (FBA) framework, which implements bespoke solutions to this end. It has recently seen a stark increase in adoption for studies of both typical (healthy) populations as well as a wide range of clinical populations. We describe the main concepts related to Fixel-Based Analyses, as well as the methods and specific steps involved in a state-of-the-art FBA pipeline, with a focus on providing researchers with practical advice on how to interpret results. We also include an overview of the scope of all current FBA studies, categorized across a broad range of neuro-scientific domains, listing key design choices and summarizing their main results and conclusions. Finally, we critically discuss several aspects and challenges involved with the FBA framework, and outline some directions and future opportunities.},

   abstract = {Voxel-based analysis of diffusion MRI data is increasingly popular. However, most white matter voxels contain contributions from multiple fibre populations (often referred to as crossing fibres), and therefore voxel-averaged quantitative measures (e.g. fractional anisotropy) are not fibre-specific and have poor interpretability. Using higher-order diffusion models, parameters related to fibre density can be extracted for individual fibre populations within each voxel (‘fixels’), and recent advances in statistics enable the multi-subject analysis of such data. However, investigating within-voxel microscopic fibre density alone does not account for macroscopic differences in the white matter morphology (e.g. the calibre of a fibre bundle). In this work, we introduce a novel method to investigate the latter, which we call fixel-based morphometry (FBM). To obtain a more complete measure related to the total number of white matter axons, information from both within-voxel microscopic fibre density and macroscopic morphology must be combined. We therefore present the FBM method as an integral piece within a comprehensive fixel-based analysis framework to investigate measures of fibre density, fibre-bundle morphology (cross-section), and a combined measure of fibre density and cross-section. We performed simulations to demonstrate the proposed measures using various transformations of a numerical fibre bundle phantom. Finally, we provide an example of such an analysis by comparing a clinical patient group to a healthy control group, which demonstrates that all three measures provide distinct and complementary information. By capturing information from both sources, the combined fibre density and cross-section measure is likely to be more sensitive to certain pathologies and more directly interpretable.},

   abstract = {To uncover mechanisms underlying chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment in breast cancer, we studied new biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neuronal survival. This cohort study included 74 women (47 ± 10 years) from 22 October 2017 until 20 August 2020. Nineteen chemotherapy-treated and 18 chemotherapy-naïve patients with breast cancer were assessed one month after the completion of surgery and/or chemotherapy, and 37 healthy controls were included. Assessments included neuropsychological testing, questionnaires, blood sampling for 17 inflammatory and two neuronal survival markers (neurofilament light-chain (NfL), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and PET-MR neuroimaging. To investigate neuroinflammation, translo-cator protein (TSPO) [18 F]DPA714-PET-MR was acquired for 15 participants per group, and evaluated by volume of distribution normalized to the cerebellum. Chemotherapy-treated patients showed higher TSPO expression, indicative for neuroinflammation, in the occipital and parietal lobe when compared to healthy controls or chemotherapy-naïve patients. After partial-volume correction, differences with healthy controls persisted (pFWE < 0.05). Additionally, compared to healthy-or chemotherapy-naïve controls, cognitive impairment (17–22%) and altered levels in blood markers (F ≥ 3.7, p ≤ 0.031) were found in chemotherapy-treated patients. NfL, an axonal damage marker, was particularly sensitive in differentiating groups (F = 105, p = 4.2 × 10−21 ), with levels 20-fold higher in chemotherapy-treated patients. Lastly, in chemotherapy-treated patients alone, higher local TSPO expression was associated with worse cognitive performance, higher blood levels of BDNF/NfL, and decreased fiber cross-section in the corpus callosum (pFWE < 0.05). These findings suggest that increased neuroinflammation is associated with chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment in breast cancer. Additionally, NfL could be a useful biomarker to assess neurotoxic effects of anticancer chemotherapies.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To uncover the neural substrate of cognitive impairment related to adjuvant chemotherapy, we studied cerebral white matter (WM) integrity before and after chemotherapy by using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in combination with detailed cognitive assessment. Patients and Methods: Thirty-four young premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer who were exposed to chemotherapy underwent neuropsychologic testing and DTI before the start of chemotherapy (t1) and 3 to 4 months after treatment (t2). Sixteen patients not exposed to chemotherapy and 19 age-matched healthy controls underwent the same assessment at matched intervals. In all groups, we used paired t tests to study changes in neuropsychologic test scores and whole-brain voxel-based paired t tests to study changes in WM fractional anisotropy (FA; a DTI measure that reflects WM tissue organization), with depression scores and intelligence quotient as included covariates. We correlated changes of neuropsychologic test scores with the mean change of FA for regions that survived the paired t tests in patients treated with chemotherapy. Results: In contrast to controls, the chemotherapy-treated group performed significantly worse on attention tests, psychomotor speed, and memory at t2 compared with t1 (P < .05). In the chemotherapy-treated group, we found significant decreases of FA in frontal, parietal, and occipital WM tracts after treatment (familywise error P < .05), whereas for both control groups, FA values were the same between t1 and t2. Furthermore, performance changes in attention and verbal memory correlated with mean regional FA changes in chemotherapy-treated patients (P < .05).

   abstract = {The removal of non-brain signal from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, known as skull-stripping, is an integral component of many neuroimage analysis streams. Despite their abundance, popular classical skull-stripping methods are usually tailored to images with specific acquisition properties, namely near-isotropic resolution and T1-weighted (T1w) MRI contrast, which are prevalent in research settings. As a result, existing tools tend to adapt poorly to other image types, such as stacks of thick slices acquired with fast spin-echo (FSE) MRI that are common in the clinic. While learning-based approaches for brain extraction have gained traction in recent years, these methods face a similar burden, as they are only effective for image types seen during the training procedure. To achieve robust skull-stripping across a landscape of imaging protocols, we introduce SynthStrip, a rapid, learning-based brain-extraction tool. By leveraging anatomical segmentations to generate an entirely synthetic training dataset with anatomies, intensity distributions, and artifacts that far exceed the realistic range of medical images, SynthStrip learns to successfully generalize to a variety of real acquired brain images, removing the need for training data with target contrasts. We demonstrate the efficacy of SynthStrip for a diverse set of image acquisitions and resolutions across subject populations, ranging from newborn to adult. We show substantial improvements in accuracy over popular skull-stripping baselines – all with a single trained model.

   abstract = {Registration of diffusion-weighted images is an important step in comparing white matter fibre bundles across subjects, or in the same subject at different time points. Using diffusion-weighted imaging, Spherical Deconvolution enables multiple fibre populations within a voxel to be resolved by computing the fibre orientation distribution (FOD). In this paper, we present a novel method that employs FODs for the registration of diffusion-weighted images. Registration was performed by optimising a symmetric diffeomorphic non-linear transformation model, using image metrics based on the mean squared difference, and cross-correlation of the FOD spherical harmonic coefficients. The proposed method was validated by recovering known displacement fields using FODs represented with maximum harmonic degrees (lmax) of 2, 4 and 6. Results demonstrate a benefit in using FODs at lmax=4 compared to lmax=2. However, a decrease in registration accuracy was observed when lmax=6 was used; this was likely caused by noise in higher harmonic degrees. We compared our proposed method to fractional anisotropy driven registration using an identical code base and parameters. FOD registration was observed to perform significantly better than FA in all experiments. The cross-correlation metric performed significantly better than the mean squared difference. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of this method by computing an unbiased group average FOD template that was used for probabilistic fibre tractography. This work suggests that using crossing fibre information aids in the alignment of white matter and could therefore benefit several methods for investigating population differences in white matter, including voxel based analysis, tensor based morphometry, atlas based segmentation and labelling, and group average fibre tractography. © 2010.},

   abstract = {Permutation methods can provide exact control of false positives and allow the use of non-standard statistics, making only weak assumptions about the data. With the availability of fast and inexpensive computing, their main limitation would be some lack of flexibility to work with arbitrary experimental designs. In this paper we report on results on approximate permutation methods that are more flexible with respect to the experimental design and nuisance variables, and conduct detailed simulations to identify the best method for settings that are typical for imaging research scenarios. We present a generic framework for permutation inference for complex general linear models (glms) when the errors are exchangeable and/or have a symmetric distribution, and show that, even in the presence of nuisance effects, these permutation inferences are powerful while providing excellent control of false positives in a wide range of common and relevant imaging research scenarios. We also demonstrate how the inference on glm parameters, originally intended for independent data, can be used in certain special but useful cases in which independence is violated. Detailed examples of common neuroimaging applications are provided, as well as a complete algorithm - the "randomise" algorithm - for permutation inference with the GLM. © 2014 The Authors.},

   abstract = {In brain regions containing crossing fibre bundles, voxel-average diffusion MRI measures such as fractional anisotropy (FA) are difficult to interpret, and lack within-voxel single fibre population specificity. Recent work has focused on the development of more interpretable quantitative measures that can be associated with a specific fibre population within a voxel containing crossing fibres (herein we use fixel to refer to a specific fibre population within a single voxel). Unfortunately, traditional 3D methods for smoothing and cluster-based statistical inference cannot be used for voxel-based analysis of these measures, since the local neighbourhood for smoothing and cluster formation can be ambiguous when adjacent voxels may have different numbers of fixels, or ill-defined when they belong to different tracts. Here we introduce a novel statistical method to perform whole-brain fixel-based analysis called connectivity-based fixel enhancement (CFE). CFE uses probabilistic tractography to identify structurally connected fixels that are likely to share underlying anatomy and pathology. Probabilistic connectivity information is then used for tract-specific smoothing (prior to the statistical analysis) and enhancement of the statistical map (using a threshold-free cluster enhancement-like approach). To investigate the characteristics of the CFE method, we assessed sensitivity and specificity using a large number of combinations of CFE enhancement parameters and smoothing extents, using simulated pathology generated with a range of test-statistic signal-to-noise ratios in five different white matter regions (chosen to cover a broad range of fibre bundle features). The results suggest that CFE input parameters are relatively insensitive to the characteristics of the simulated pathology. We therefore recommend a single set of CFE parameters that should give near optimal results in future studies where the group effect is unknown. We then demonstrate the proposed method by comparing apparent fibre density between motor neurone disease (MND) patients with control subjects. The MND results illustrate the benefit of fixel-specific statistical inference in white matter regions that contain crossing fibres.},

   abstract = {Objective: The need for appropriate multiple comparisons correction when performing statistical inference is not a new problem. However, it has come to the forefront in many new modern data-intensive disciplines. For example, researchers in areas such as imaging and genetics are routinely required to simultaneously perform thousands of statistical tests. Ignoring this multiplicity can cause severe problems with false positives, thereby introducing nonreproducible results into the literature. Methods: This article serves as an introduction to hypothesis testing and multiple comparisons for practical research applications, with a particular focus on its use in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Results:We discuss hypothesis testing and a variety of principled techniques for correcting for multiple tests.We also illustrate potential pitfalls problems that can occur if the multiple comparisons issue is not dealt with properly. We conclude, by discussing effect size estimation, an issue often linked with the multiple comparisons problem. Conclusions: Failure to properly account for multiple comparisons will ultimately lead to heightened risks for false positives and erroneous conclusions.},

   abstract = {This chapter describes the utility of diffusion MRI for extraction of microstructural information of neuronal tissue, specifically the white matter. Neuronal tissues in general, and white matter in particular, are complex tissue structures composed of several cellular compartments. Diffusion MRI has the potential to infer features of these compartments as it actually measures the mean displacement of water molecules rather than their diffusion coefficient. Thus, assuming that the displacement of water molecules is affected by tissue microstructure, diffusion MRI should become sensitive to structural parameters of the tissue. The signal decay in diffusion MRI experiments is complicated and only part of it is acquired and analyzed by conventional diffusion imaging (diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)). When acquiring the entire signal decay, it is apparent that it is composed of several diffusing components (free, hindered, and restricted diffusion), allowing compartment-specific information to be retrieved, using advanced acquisition and analysis frameworks. The analysis frameworks (e.g. q-space imaging and the composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion (CHARMED)) follow the q-space theory and relate signal properties to displacement characteristics. It is suggested that restricted diffusion is apparent in neuronal tissues with water molecule diffusion within the axons as the main contributor to it. Thus restricted diffusion as measured by MRI enables the extraction of quantitative, morphologically related parameters such as the axon density and axon diameter distributions. The different analysis routines and their biophysical meaning along with selected applications are presented and discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Purpose Treatment modalities for breast cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide, include surgery, radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormonal therapy. The advancement in medical technology has facilitated substantial reduction in breast cancer mortality. However, patients may experience cognitive impairment after chemotherapy. This phenomenon called chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (i.e., “chemobrain”) is common among breast cancer survivors. However, cognitive function deficits may exist before chemotherapy initiation. This study examined the functional network alterations in breast survivors by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods We recruited 172 female participants and separated them into three groups: C+ (57 breast cancer survivors who had finished 3–12-month-long chemotherapy), C- (45 breast cancer survivors who had not undergone chemotherapy), and HC (70 participants with no breast cancer history). We analyzed mean fractional amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuation and graph theoretical topologies from resting-state fMRI and applied network-based analysis to portray functional changes among the three groups. Results Among the three groups, the C- group demonstrated hyperactivity in the prefrontal cortex, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus and right angular gyrus. Only the left caudate demonstrated significantly more hypoactivity in the C- group than in the C+ group. Graph theoretical analysis demonstrated that the brains of the C+ group became inclined toward regular networks and the brains of the C- group became inclined toward random networks. Conclusion Subtle alterations were noted in the brain activity and networks of our cancer survivors. Moreover, functional network disruptions occurred regardless of chemotherapeutic agent administration.},

   abstract = {A subgroup of patients with breast cancer suffers from mild cognitive impairment after chemotherapy. To uncover the neural substrate of these mental complaints, we examined cerebral white matter (WM) integrity after chemotherapy using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in combination with detailed cognitive assessment. Postchemotherapy breast cancer patients (n = 17) and matched healthy controls (n = 18) were recruited for DTI and neuropsychological testing, including the self-report cognitive failure questionnaire (CFQ). Differences in DTI WM integrity parameters [fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD)] between patients and healthy controls were assessed using a voxel-based two-sample-t-test. In comparison with healthy controls, the patient group demonstrated decreased FA in frontal and temporal WM tracts and increased MD in frontal WM. These differences were also confirmed when comparing this patient group with an additional control group of nonchemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients (n = 10). To address the heterogeneity observed in cognitive function after chemotherapy, we performed a voxel-based correlation analysis between FA values and individual neuropsychological test scores. Significant correlations of FA with neuropsychological tests covering the domain of attention and processing/psychomotor speed were found in temporal and parietal WM tracts. Furthermore, CFQ scores correlated negatively in frontal and parietal WM. These studies show that chemotherapy seems to affect WM integrity and that parameters derived from DTI have the required sensitivity to quantify neural changes related to chemotherapy-induced mild cognitive impairment. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {Objective: We aimed to use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to detect alterations in white matter microstructure in older patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Methods: We recruited women age ≥60 years with stage I–III breast cancer (chemotherapy [CT] group; n = 19) to undergo two study assessments: at baseline and within one month after chemotherapy. Each assessment consisted of a brain magnetic resonance imaging scan with DTI and neuropsychological (NP) testing using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox Cognition Battery. An age- and sex-matched group of healthy controls (HC, n = 14) underwent the same assessments at matched intervals. Four DTI parameters (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity [MD], axial diffusivity [AD], and radial diffusivity [RD]) were calculated and correlated with NP testing scores. Results: For CT group but not HCs, we detected statistically significant increases in MD and RD in the genu of the corpus callosum from time point 1 to time point 2 at p < 0.01, effect size:0.3655 and 0.3173, and 95% confidence interval: from 0.1490 to 0.5821, and from 0.1554 to 0.4792, for MD and RD respectively. AD values increased for the CT group and decreased for the HC group over time, resulting in significant between-group differences (p = 0.0056, effect size:1.0215, 95% confidence interval: from 0.2773 to 1.7657). There were no significant correlations between DTI parameters and NP scores (p > 0.05). Conclusions: We identified alterations in white matter microstructures in older women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. These findings may potentially serve as neuroimaging biomarkers for identifying cognitive impairment in older adults with cancer.},

   abstract = {Objectives: To date, only four small studies have investigated the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer on the microstructure of cerebral white matter with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These studies, which were conducted shortly up to 10 years post-treatment, showed that chemotherapy is associated with focal loss of microstructural white matter integrity. We investigated the long-term effect of chemotherapy on white matter microstructural integrity by comparing the brains of chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer survivors to those of a population-based sample of women without a history of cancer. Experimental design: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI (1.5 T) was performed in 187 CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-flourouracil) chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer survivors, mean age 64.2 (sd = 6.5) years, who had been diagnosed with cancer on average 21.2 (sd = 4.4) years before, and 374 age-matched cancer-free reference subjects from a population-based cohort study. Outcome measures were whole-brain microstructural integrity as measured by fractional anisotropy and mean/axial/radial diffusivity and focal white matter integrity, which was analyzed with tract-based spatial statistics. All analyses were adjusted for age, cardiovascular risk factors, education, and symptoms of depression. Principal observations: No significant group differences were observed in white matter integrity. However, within the breast cancer survivors, time since treatment was inversely associated with lower global and focal white matter integrity. Conclusions: This cross-sectional study suggests that among chemotherapy-exposed breast cancer survivors white matter microstructural integrity deteriorates with accumulating time since treatment. This warrants further investigation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

One of its main applications is fiber tractography. The noisy nature of diffusion-weighted (DW) images, however, affects the estimated orientations and the resulting fiber trajectories will be subject to uncertainty. The impact of noise can be large, especially for HARDI measurements, which employ relatively high b-values. To quantify the effects of noise on fiber trajectories, probabilistic tractography was introduced, which considers multiple possible pathways emanating from one seed point, taking into account the uncertainty of local fiber orientations. In this work, a probabilistic tractography algorithm is presented based on CSD and the residual bootstrap. CSD, which provides accurate and precise estimates of multiple fiber orientations, is used to extract the local fiber orientations. The residual bootstrap is used to estimate fiber tract probability within a clinical time frame, without prior assumptions about the form of uncertainty in the data. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, the performance of the CSD fiber pathway uncertainty estimator is measured in terms of accuracy and precision. In addition, the performance of the proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art DTI residual bootstrap tractography and to an existing probabilistic CSD tractography algorithm using clinical DW data. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

AFD has the potential to provide specific information regarding differences between populations by identifying not only the location, but also the orientations along which differences exist. In this work, analytical and numerical Monte-Carlo simulations are used to support the use of the FOD amplitude as a quantitative measure (i.e. AFD) for population and longitudinal analysis. To perform robust voxel-based analysis of AFD, we present and evaluate a novel method to modulate the FOD to account for changes in fibre bundle cross-sectional area that occur during spatial normalisation. We then describe a novel approach for statistical analysis of AFD that uses cluster-based inference of differences extended throughout space and orientation. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed method by performing voxel-based AFD comparisons between a group of Motor Neurone Disease patients and healthy control subjects.A significant decrease in AFD was detected along voxels and orientations corresponding to both the corticospinal tract and corpus callosal fibres that connect the primary motor cortices. In addition to corroborating previous findings in MND, this study demonstrates the clear advantage of using this type of analysis by identifying differences along single fibre bundles in regions containing multiple fibre populations. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Diffusion MRI allows the structural connectivity of the whole brain (the 'tractogram') to be estimated in vivo non-invasively using streamline tractography. The biological accuracy of these data sets is however limited by the inherent biases associated with the reconstruction method. Here we propose a method to retrospectively improve the accuracy of these reconstructions, by selectively filtering out streamlines from the tractogram in a manner that improves the fit between the streamline reconstruction and the underlying diffusion images. This filtering is guided by the results of spherical deconvolution of the diffusion signal, hence the acronym SIFT: spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms. Data sets processed by this algorithm show a marked reduction in known reconstruction biases, and improved biological plausibility. Emerging methods in diffusion MRI, particularly those that aim to characterise and compare the structural connectivity of the brain, should benefit from the improved accuracy of the reconstruction. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The pipeline consists of 3 steps: 1) Preprocessing, including image format converting, image quality check, eddy-current and motion artifact correction, skull stripping and tensor image estimation, 2) study-specific unbiased DTI atlas computation via affine followed by fluid nonlinear registration and warping of all individual DTI images into the common atlas space to achieve voxel-wise correspondence, 3) voxelwise statistical analysis via heterogeneous linear regression and wild bootstrap technique for correcting for multiple comparisons. This pipeline was applied to process data from a fitness and aging study and preliminary results are presented.

   abstract = {The success of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is deeply rooted in the powerful concept that during their random, diffusion-driven displacements molecules probe tissue structure at a microscopic scale well beyond the usual image resolution. As diffusion is truly a three-dimensional process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional MRI, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. DTI has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols. The aim of this article is to review the concepts behind DTI and to present potential applications. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {Integration of the neural processes in the human brain is realized through interconnections that exist between different neural centers. These interconnections take place through white matter pathways. White matter tractography is currently the only available technique for the reconstruction of the anatomical connectivity in the human brain noninvasively and in vivo. The trajectory and terminations of white matter pathways are estimated from local orientations of nerve bundles. These orientations are obtained using measurements of water diffusion in the brain. In this article, the techniques for estimating fiber directions from diffusion measurements in the human brain are reviewed. Methods of white matter tractography are described, together with the current limitations of the technique, including sensitivity to image noise and partial voluming. The applications of white matter tractography to the topographical characterization of the white matter connections and the segmentation of specific white matter pathways, and corresponding functional units of gray matter, are discussed. In this context, the potential impact of white matter tractography in mapping the functional systems and subsystems in the human brain, and their interrelations, is described. Finally, the applications of white matter tractography to the study of brain disorders, including fiber tract localization in brains affected by tumors and the identification of impaired connectivity routes in neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases, are discussed. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can resolve the white matter fiber orientation within a voxel provided that the fibers are strongly aligned. However, a given voxel may contain a distribution of fiber orientations due to, for example, intravoxel fiber crossing. The present study sought to test whether a geodesic, high b-value diffusion gradient sampling scheme could resolve multiple fiber orientations within a single voxel. In regions of fiber crossing the diffusion signal exhibited multiple local maxima/minima as a function of diffusion gradient orientation, indicating the presence of multiple intravoxel fiber orientations. The multimodality of the observed diffusion signal precluded the standard tensor reconstruction, so instead the diffusion signal was modeled as arising from a discrete mixture of Gaussian diffusion processes in slow exchange, and the underlying mixture of tensors was solved for using a gradient descent scheme. The multitensor reconstruction resolved multiple intravoxel fiber populations corresponding to known fiber anatomy. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {Indices of diffusion anisotropy calculated from diffusion coefficients acquired in two or three perpendicular directions are rotationally variant. In living monkey brain, these indices severely underestimate the degree of diffusion anisotropy. New indices calculated from the entire diffusion tensor are rotationally invariant (RI). They show that anisotropy is highly variable in different white matter regions depending on the degree of coherence of fiber tract directions. In structures with a regular, parallel fiber arrangement, water diffusivity in the direction parallel to the fibers (D is parallel with ≃ 1400-1800 x 10-6 mm2/s) is almost 10 times higher than the average diffusivity in directions perpendicular to them ((D + D is perpendicular to')/2 ≃ 150-300 x 10-6 mm2/s), and is almost three times higher than previously reported. In structures where the fiber pattern is less coherent (e.g., where fiber bundles merge), diffusion anisotropy is significantly reduced. However, RI anisotropy indices are still susceptible to noise contamination. Monte Carlo simulations show that these indices are statistically biased, particularly those requiring sorting of the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor based on their magnitude. A new intervoxel anisotropy index is proposed that locally averages inner products between diffusion tensors in neighboring voxels. This 'lattice' RI index has an acceptably low error variance and is less susceptible to bias than any other RI anisotropy index proposed to date.},

   abstract = {Though mild cognitive impairment is an intermediate clinical state between healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), there are very few whole-brain voxel-wise diffusion MRI studies directly comparing changes in healthy control, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects. Here we report whole-brain findings from a comprehensive study of diffusion tensor indices and probabilistic tractography obtained in a very large population of healthy controls, MCI and probable AD subjects. As expected from the literature, all diffusion indices converged to show that the cingulum bundle, the uncinate fasciculus, the entire corpus callosum and the superior longitudinal fasciculus are the most affected white matter tracts in AD. Significant differences between MCI and AD were essentially confined to the corpus callosum. More importantly, we introduce for the first time in a degenerative disorder an application of a recently developed tensor index, the "mode" of anisotropy, as well as probabilistic crossing-fibre tractography. The mode of anisotropy specifies the type of anisotropy as a continuous measure reflecting differences in shape of the diffusion tensor ranging from planar (e.g., in regions of crossing fibres from two fibre populations of similar density or regions of "kissing" fibres) to linear (e.g., in regions where one fibre population orientation predominates), while probabilistic crossing-fibre tractography allows to accurately trace pathways from a crossing-fibre region. Remarkably, when looking for whole-brain diffusion differences between MCI patients and healthy subjects, the only region with significant abnormalities was a region of crossing fibres in the centrum semiovale, showing an increased mode of anisotropy. The only white matter region demonstrating a significant difference in correlations between neuropsychological scores and a diffusion measure (mode of anisotropy) across the three groups was the same region of crossing fibres. Further examination using probabilistic tractography established explicitly and quantitatively that this previously unreported increase of mode and co-localised increase of fractional anisotropy was explained by a relative preservation of motor-related projection fibres (at this early stage of the disease) crossing the association fibres of the superior longitudinal fasciculus. These findings emphasise the benefit of looking at the more complex regions in which spared and affected pathways are crossing to detect very early alterations of the white matter that could not be detected in regions consisting of one fibre population only. Finally, the methods used in this study may have general applicability for other degenerative disorders and, beyond the clinical sphere, they could contribute to a better quantification and understanding of subtle effects generated by normal processes such as visuospatial attention or motor learning. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {It has long been recognized that the diffusion tensor model is inappropriate to characterize complex fiber architecture, causing tensor-derived measures such as the primary eigenvector and fractional anisotropy to be unreliable or misleading in these regions. There is however still debate about the impact of this problem in practice. A recent study using a Bayesian automatic relevance detection (ARD) multicompartment model suggested that a third of white matter (WM) voxels contain crossing fibers, a value that, whilst already significant, is likely to be an underestimate. The aim of this study is to provide more robust estimates of the proportion of affected voxels, the number of fiber orientations within each WM voxel, and the impact on tensor-derived analyses, using large, high-quality diffusion-weighted data sets, with reconstruction parameters optimized specifically for this task. Two reconstruction algorithms were used: constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD), and the ARD method used in the previous study. We estimate the proportion of WM voxels containing crossing fibers to be ~90% (using CSD) and 63% (using ARD). Both these values are much higher than previously reported, strongly suggesting that the diffusion tensor model is inadequate in the vast majority of WM regions. This has serious implications for downstream processing applications that depend on this model, particularly tractography, and the interpretation of anisotropy and radial/axial diffusivity measures. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this review, we highlight the main steps that have led the field of diffusion imaging to move from the tensor model to the adoption of diffusion and fibre orientation density functions as a more effective way to describe the complexity of white matter organization within each brain voxel. Among several techniques, spherical deconvolution has emerged today as one of the main approaches to model multiple fibre orientations and for tractography applications. Here we illustrate the main concepts and the reasoning behind this technique, as well as the latest developments in the field.

When segmenting brain scans, CNNs are highly sensitive to changes in resolution and contrast: even within the same MRI modality, performance can decrease across datasets. Here we introduce SynthSeg, the first segmentation CNN robust against changes in contrast and resolution. SynthSeg is trained with synthetic data sampled from a generative model conditioned on segmentations. Crucially, we adopt a domain randomisation strategy where we fully randomise the contrast and resolution of the synthetic training data. Consequently, SynthSeg can segment real scans from a wide range of target domains without retraining or fine-tuning, which enables straightforward analysis of huge amounts of heterogeneous clinical data. Because SynthSeg only requires segmentations to be trained (no images), it can learn from labels obtained by automated methods on diverse populations (e.g., ageing and diseased), thus achieving robustness to a wide range of morphological variability. We demonstrate SynthSeg on 5,000 scans of six modalities (including CT) and ten resolutions, where it exhibits unparallelled generalisation compared with supervised CNNs, state-of-the-art domain adaptation, and Bayesian segmentation. Finally, we demonstrate the generalisability of SynthSeg by applying it to cardiac MRI and CT scans.},

Existing studies evaluated image registration algorithms in specific tasks or using specific databases (e.g., only for skull-stripped images, only for single-site images, etc.). Consequently, the choice of registration algorithms seems task- and usage/parameter-dependent. Nevertheless, recent large-scale, often multi-institutional imaging-related studies create the need and raise the question whether some registration algorithms can 1) generally apply to various tasks/databases posing various challenges; 2) perform consistently well, and while doing so, 3) require minimal or ideally no parameter tuning. In seeking answers to this question, we evaluated 12 general-purpose registration algorithms, for their generality, accuracy and robustness. We fixed their parameters at values suggested by algorithm developers as reported in the literature. We tested them in 7 databases/tasks, which present one or more of 4 commonly-encountered challenges: 1) inter-subject anatomical variability in skull-stripped images; 2) intensity homogeneity, noise and large structural differences in raw images; 3) imaging protocol and field-of-view (FOV) differences in multi-site data; and 4) missing correspondences in pathology-bearing images. Totally 7,562 registrations were performed. Registration accuracies were measured by (multi-)expert-annotated landmarks or regions of interest (ROIs). To ensure reproducibility, we used public software tools, public databases (whenever possible), and we fully disclose the parameter settings. We show evaluation results, and discuss the performances in light of algorithms' similarity metrics, transformation models and optimization strategies. We also discuss future directions for the algorithm development and evaluations.},

   abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly , the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

Use of an accurate streamlines propagation mask from segmentation of an anatomical image confines the streamlines to the volume of the brain white matter, but does not take full advantage of all of the information available from such an image. We present a modular addition to streamlines tractography, which makes more effective use of the information available from anatomical image segmentation, and the known properties of the neuronal axons being reconstructed, to apply biologically realistic priors to the streamlines generated; we refer to this as "Anatomically-Constrained Tractography".

   abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is increasingly considered a large-scale network disconnection syndrome, associated with progressive aggregation of pathological proteins, cortical atrophy, and functional disconnections between brain regions. These pathological changes are posited to arise in a stereotypical spatiotemporal manner, targeting intrinsic networks in the brain, most notably the default mode network. While this network-specific disruption has been thoroughly studied with functional neuroimaging, changes to specific white matter fibre pathways within the brain's structural networks have not been closely investigated, largely due to the challenges of modelling complex white matter structure. Here, we applied a novel technique known as 'fixel-based analysis' to comprehensively investigate fibre tract-specific differences at a within-voxel level (called 'fixels') to assess potential axonal loss in subjects with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. We hypothesized that patients with Alzheimer's disease would exhibit extensive degeneration across key fibre pathways connecting default network nodes, while patients with mild cognitive impairment would exhibit selective degeneration within fibre pathways connecting regions previously identified as functionally implicated early in Alzheimer's disease. Diffusion MRI data from Alzheimer's disease (n = 49), mild cognitive impairment (n = 33), and healthy elderly control subjects (n = 95) were obtained from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study of ageing. We assessed microstructural differences in fibre density, and macrostructural differences in fibre bundle morphology using fixel-based analysis. Whole-brain analysis was performed to compare groups across all white matter fixels. Subsequently, we performed a tract of interest analysis comparing fibre density and cross-section across 11 selected white matter tracts, to investigate potentially subtle degeneration within fibre pathways in mild cognitive impairment, initially by clinical diagnosis alone, and then by including amyloid status (i.e. a positive or negative amyloid PET scan). Our whole-brain analysis revealed significant white matter loss manifesting both microstructurally and macrostructurally in Alzheimer's disease patients, evident in specific fibre pathways associated with default mode network nodes. Reductions in fibre density and cross-section in mild cognitive impairment patients were only exhibited within the posterior cingulum when statistical analyses were limited to tracts of interest. Interestingly, these degenerative changes did not appear to be associated with high amyloid accumulation, given that amyloid-negative, but not positive, mild cognitive impairment subjects exhibited subtle focal left posterior cingulum deficits. The findings of this study demonstrated a stereotypical distribution of white matter degeneration in patients with Alzheimer's disease, which was in line with canonical findings from other imaging modalities, and with a network-based conceptualization of the disease.},

   abstract = {Statistically underpowered studies can result in experimental failure even when all other experimental considerations have been addressed impeccably. In fMRI the combination of a large number of dependent variables, a relatively small number of observations (subjects), and a need to correct for multiple comparisons can decrease statistical power dramatically. This problem has been clearly addressed yet remains controversial—especially in regards to the expected effect sizes in fMRI, and especially for between-subjects effects such as group comparisons and brain-behavior correlations. We aimed to clarify the power problem by considering and contrasting two simulated scenarios of such possible brain-behavior correlations: weak diffuse effects and strong localized effects. Sampling from these scenarios shows that, particularly in the weak diffuse scenario, common sample sizes (n = 20–30) display extremely low statistical power, poorly represent the actual effects in the full sample, and show large variation on subsequent replications. Empirical data from the Human Connectome Project resembles the weak diffuse scenario much more than the localized strong scenario, which underscores the extent of the power problem for many studies. Possible solutions to the power problem include increasing the sample size, using less stringent thresholds, or focusing on a region-of-interest. However, these approaches are not always feasible and some have major drawbacks. The most prominent solutions that may help address the power problem include model-based (multivariate) prediction methods and meta-analyses with related synthesis-oriented approaches.},

One major limitation of current methods is the spatial scale of the information available. We present an approach to gain spatial resolution using post-processing methods based on diffusion MRI fiber-tracking, to reveal structures beyond the resolution of the acquired imaging voxel; we term such a method as super-resolution track-density imaging (TDI). A major unmet challenge in imaging is the identification of abnormalities in white matter as a cause of illness; super-resolution TDI is shown to produce high-quality white matter images, with high spatial resolution and outstanding anatomical contrast. A unique property of these maps is demonstrated: their spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio can be tailored depending on the chosen image resolution and total number of fiber-tracks generated. Super-resolution TDI should greatly enhance the study of white matter in disorders of the brain and mind. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR images contain information about the orientation of brain white matter fibres that potentially can be used to study human brain connectivity in vivo using tractography techniques. Currently, the diffusion tensor model is widely used to extract fibre directions from DW-MRI data, but fails in regions containing multiple fibre orientations. The spherical deconvolution technique has recently been proposed to address this limitation. It provides an estimate of the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) by assuming the DW signal measured from any fibre bundle is adequately described by a single response function. However, the deconvolution is ill-conditioned and susceptible to noise contamination. This tends to introduce artefactual negative regions in the FOD, which are clearly physically impossible. In this study, the introduction of a constraint on such negative regions is proposed to improve the conditioning of the spherical deconvolution. This approach is shown to provide FOD estimates that are robust to noise whilst preserving angular resolution. The approach also permits the use of super-resolution, whereby more FOD parameters are estimated than were actually measured, improving the angular resolution of the results. The method provides much better defined fibre orientation estimates, and allows orientations to be resolved that are separated by smaller angles than previously possible. This should allow tractography algorithms to be designed that are able to track reliably through crossing fibre regions. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Purpose: To estimate the spatially varying noise map using a redundant series of magnitude MR images. Methods: We exploit redundancy in non-Gaussian distributed multidirectional diffusion MRI data by identifying its noise-only principal components, based on the theory of noisy covariance matrices. The bulk of principal component analysis eigenvalues, arising due to noise, is described by the universal Marchenko–Pastur distribution, parameterized by the noise level. This allows us to estimate noise level in a local neighborhood based on the singular value decomposition of a matrix combining neighborhood voxels and diffusion directions. Results: We present a model-independent local noise mapping method capable of estimating the noise level down to about 1% error. In contrast to current state-of-the-art techniques, the resultant noise maps do not show artifactual anatomical features that often reflect physiological noise, the presence of sharp edges, or a lack of adequate a priori knowledge of the expected form of MR signal. Conclusions: Simulations and experiments show that typical diffusion MRI data exhibit sufficient redundancy that enables accurate, precise, and robust estimation of the local noise level by interpreting the principal component analysis eigenspectrum in terms of the Marchenko–Pastur distribution.

   abstract = {Purpose: To develop a fast and stable method for correcting the gibbs-ringing artifact. Methods: Gibbs-ringing is a well-known artifact which manifests itself as spurious oscillations in the vicinity of sharp image gradients at tissue boundaries. The origin can be seen in the truncation of k-space during MRI data-acquisition. Correction techniques like Gegenbauer reconstruction or extrapolation methods aim at recovering these missing data. Here, we present a simple and robust method which exploits a different view on the Gibbs-phenomenon: The truncation in k-space can be interpreted as a convolution of the underlying image with a sinc-function. As the image is reconstructed on a discretized grid, the severity of the ringing artifacts depends on how this grid is located with respect to the edge and the oscillation pattern of the function. We propose to reinterpolate the image based on local, subvoxel-shifts to sample the ringing pattern at the zero-crossings of the oscillating sinc-function. Results: With the proposed method, the artifact can simply, effectively, and robustly be removed with a minimal amount of image smoothing. Conclusions: The robustness of the method suggests it as a suitable candidate for an implementation in the standard image processing pipeline in clinical routine.

We aimed to investigate changes in white matter and cognitive functioning following computerized cognitive training. Methods.

Sixteen healthy controls (HC) (age 15.6 ± 1.8 years) completed DWI assessment at time point 1 and cognitive assessment at time point 1 and 2. Fixel-based analyses were used to examine fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and fiber cross-section (FC) on a whole brain level and in tracts of interest. Results. Patients with TBI showed cognitive impairments and extensive areas with decreased FA and increased MD together with an increase in FC in the body of the corpus callosum and left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) at time point 1. Patients improved significantly on the inhibition measure at time point 2, whereas the HC group remained unchanged. No training-induced changes were observed on the group level in diffusion metrics. Exploratory correlations were found between improvements on verbal working memory and reduced MD of the left SLF and between increased performance on an information processing speed task and increased FA of the right precentral gyrus. Conclusions. Results are indicative of positive effects of BrainGames on cognitive functioning and provide preliminary evidence for neuroplasticity associated with cognitive improvements following cognitive intervention in TBI.},

In total, 180 women participated in this study, of whom 72 patients with breast cancer had received adjuvant chemotherapy (C+), 49 patients did not receive chemotherapy (C−), and 59 healthy controls (HC).

Cognitive impairment occurred after chemotherapy in both young and older patients, although older patients showed more decline in processing speed (Trail making test b). White matter volume expansion was observed after chemotherapy, only significantly present in the younger subgroup of patients. In patients not treated with chemotherapy, diffuse gray and white matter volume reduction was observed. Less white matter expansion concurred with more cognitive decline (r >.349, p <.05). In conclusion, we found age-dependent cognitive decline and white matter volume changes in patients with breast cancer after chemotherapy, which could possibly be linked to neuroinflammatory processes. White matter expansion after chemotherapy, more pronounced in premenopausal patients, correlated with less cognitive decline. This suggests such expansion to be age-dependent, possibly caused by a protective response in the younger brain to chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity.},

   abstract = {Animal studies have reinforced clinical reports of cognitive impairment in cancer survivors following chemotherapy but, until now, all pre-clinical research in this area has been conducted on normal rodents. The present study investigated the effects of chemotherapy on cognition and underlying biological mechanisms in the FVB/N-Tg (MMTV-neu) 202 Mul/J mouse, a well-characterized transgenic model of breast cancer that has similarities to the tumorigenesis which occurs in humans. Tumor-bearing and control mice received three weekly injections of a combination of methotrexate + 5-fluorouracil, or an equal volume of saline. Different aspects of learning and memory were measured before and after treatment. The effects of tumor and chemotherapy on neurogenesis, neuro-inflammatory cytokine activity, and brain volume, as they relate to corresponding cognitive changes, were also measured. The toxic effects of chemotherapy extended to the cancerous model in which substantial cognitive impairment was also associated with the disease. Cognitive deficits were greatest in tumorigenic mice that received the anti-cancer drugs. Both tumor growth and chemotherapy caused significant changes in brain volume, including the hippocampus and frontal lobes, two structures that are directly implicated in cognitive tasks that were shown to be vulnerable. The level of hippocampal neurogenesis in adulthood was suppressed in chemotherapy-treated mice and associated with loss of hippocampus-controlled cognitive function. Dysregulation of cytokine activity was found in tumorigenic mice and associated with impaired cognitive performance. The results show that chemotherapy and tumor development independently contribute to cognitive deficits through different biological mechanisms.},

The development of approaches to improve memory attracts much attention due to the underlying mechanistic insight and therapeutic potential to treat neurodegenerative diseases with memory loss, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a reversible, adjustable, and non-ablative therapy, has been shown to be safe and effective in many clinical trials for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Among all potential regions with access to invasive electrodes, fornix is considered as it is the major afferent and efferent connection of the hippocampus known to be closely associated with learning and memory. Indeed, clinical trials have demonstrated that fornix DBS globally improved cognitive function in a subset of patients with AD, indicating fornix can serve as a potential target for neurosurgical intervention in treating memory impairment in AD. The present review aims to provide a better understanding of recent progresses in the application of fornix DBS for ameliorating memory impairments in AD patients.},

As the most prevalent cause of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) dramatically impairs the quality of life of patients and imposes a significant societal burden on the healthcare system. As an established treatment for movement disorders, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently being investigated in preclinical and clinical studies for treatment of memory impairment in AD by modulating fornix activity. Optimal target and stimulation parameters to potentially rescue memory deficits have yet to be determined. The aim of this review is to consolidate the structural and functional aspects of the fornix in the context of neuromodulation for memory deficits. We first present an anatomical and functional overview of the fibres and structures interconnected by the fornix. Recent evidence from preclinical models suggests that the fornix is subdivided into two distinct functional axes: A septohippocampal pathway and a subiculothalamic pathway. Each pathway's target and origin structures are presented, followed by a discussion of their oscillatory dynamics and functional connectivity. Overall, neuromodulation of each pathway of the fornix is discussed in the context of evidence-based forniceal DBS strategies. It is not yet known whether driving fornix activity can enhance cognition-optimal target and stimulation parameters to rescue memory deficits have yet to be determined.},

   abstract = {Background: Previous case studies have provided evidence for chemotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy in patients with breast cancer. However, prospective research is lacking. Hence, we investigated leukoencephalopathy before and after chemotherapy and its association with a serum neuroaxonal damage marker. Methods: This prospective cohort study included 40 patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer, and two age- and education-matched control groups, recruited between 2018 and 2021 (31–64 years of age). The latter control groups consisted of 39 chemotherapy-naïve patients and 40 healthy women. Fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery magnetic resonance imaging was used for lesion volumetry (total, juxtacortical, periventricular, infratentorial, and deep white matter) and blood serum to measure neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels. Acquisition took place pre-chemotherapy and three months and one-year post-chemotherapy, or at corresponding intervals. Within/between group differences were compared using robust mixed-effects modeling, and associations between total lesion volume and serum-NfL with linear regression. Results: Stronger increases in deep white matter lesion volumes were observed shortly post-chemotherapy, compared with healthy women (ßstandardized=0.09, pFDR<0.001). Increases in total lesion volume could mainly be attributed to enlargement of existing lesions (mean±SD, 0.12±0.16 mL), rather than development of new lesions (0.02±0.02 mL). A stronger increase in serum-NfL concentration was observed shortly post-chemotherapy compared with both control groups (ß>0.70, p<0.004), neither of which showed any changes over time, whereas a decrease was observed compared with healthy women one-year post-chemotherapy (ß=-0.54, p = 0.002). Serum-NfL concentrations were associated with lesion volume one-year post-chemotherapy (or at matched timepoint; ß=0.36, p = 0.010), whereas baseline or short-term post-therapy levels or changes were not. Conclusion: These results underscore the possibility of chemotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy months post-treatment, as well as the added value of serum-NfL as a prognostic marker for peripheral/central neurotoxicity. Translational relevance: Previous case studies have provided evidence of chemotherapy-induced leukoencephalopathy in patients with breast cancer. However, prospective studies to estimate longitudinal changes are currently missing. In this study, we used longitudinal fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery magnetic resonance imaging to assess white matter lesion volumes in patients treated for non-metastatic breast cancer and healthy women. Our findings demonstrate that chemotherapy-treated patients exhibit stronger increases in lesion volumes compared with healthy women, specifically in deep white matter, at three months post-chemotherapy. Increases could mainly be attributed to enlargement of existing lesions, rather than development of new lesions. Last, serum concentrations of neurofilament light chain, a neuroaxonal damage marker, increased shortly after chemotherapy and long-term post-chemotherapy levels were associated with lesion volumes. These findings highlight the potential of this non-invasive serum marker as a prognostic marker for peripheral and/or central neurotoxicity. Implementation in clinical practice could aid in therapeutic decisions, assessing disease activity, or monitoring treatment response.},

   abstract = {Ageing displays a low-grade pro-inflammatory profile in blood and the brain. Accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia activation and volumetric changes in the brain correlate with cognitive decline in ageing models. However, the interplay between them is not totally understood. Here, we aimed to globally identify an age-dependent pro-inflammatory profile and microglia morphological plasticity that favors major volume changes in the brain associated with cognitive decline. Cluster analysis of behavioral data obtained from 2-,12- and 20-month-old male C57BL/6 mice revealed age-dependent cognitive decline after the Y-maze, Barnes maze, object recognition (NORT) and object location tests (OLT). Global magnetic resonance imageing (MRI) analysis by deformation-based morphometry (DBM) in the brain identified a volume increase in the fornix and a decrease in the left medial entorhinal cortex (MEntC) during ageing. Notably, the fornix shows an increase in the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas the left MEntC displays a decrease. Morphological assessment of microglia also confirms an active and dystrophic phenotype in the fornix and a surveillance phenotype in the left MEntC. Finally, biological modeling revealed that age-related volume increase in the fornix was associated with dystrophic microglia and cognitive impairment, as evidenced by failure on tasks examining memory of object location and novelty. Our results propose that the morphological plasticity of microglia might contribute to volumetric changes in brain regions associated with cognitive decline during physiological ageing.},

This study aims to explore the relationship between depression and the volumes of specific nuclei within these brain regions. Understanding these connections could provide deeper insights into the biological mechanisms underlying depression. Methods: Seventy-three healthy individuals and 39 patients with depression were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory or Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. All participants underwent 3.0T MRI, and the volumes of subnuclei in the hypothalamus and limbic system were measured. Results: The results revealed increased volumes in both the inferior tubular areas of the hypothalamus and the left hypothalamus in the patient group with depression. Moreover, the left infTub volume initially increased during the first three years of depression, followed by a decrease, suggesting distinct structural changes between early and chronic stages of the illness. Conclusions: Alterations in the left inferior tubular area volume suggest a connection between the hypothalamus and the chronicity of depressive symptoms. Further exploration of specific nuclei in the hypothalamus promises deeper insights into depression's biological mechanisms.},

   abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative dementia. Researchers have long been focused on the cortical pathology of AD, since the most important pathologic features are the senile plaques found in the cortex, and the neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss that begin in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. In addition to these gray matter (GM) structures, histopathological studies indicate that the white matter (WM) is also a good target for both the early diagnosis of AD and for monitoring disease progression. The fornix is a WM bundle that constitutes a core element of the limbic circuits, and is one of the most important anatomical structures related to memory. Functional and anatomical features of the fornix have naturally captured researchers' attention as possible diagnostic and prognostic markers of AD. Indeed, neurodegeneration of the fornix has been histologically observed in AD, and growing evidence indicates that the alterations seen in the fornix are potentially a good marker to predict future conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, and even from cognitively normal individuals to AD. The degree of alteration is correlated with the degree of memory impairment, indicating the potential for the use of the fornix as a functional marker. Moreover, there have been attempts to stimulate the fornix using deep brain stimulation (DBS) to augment cognitive function in AD, and ongoing research has suggested positive effects of DBS on brain glucose metabolism in AD patients. On the other hand, disease specificity for fornix degeneration, methodologies to evaluate fornix degeneration, and the clinical significance of the fornix DBS, especially for the long-term impact on the quality of life, are mostly unknown and need to be elucidated.},

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7%), followed by lung (11.4%), colorectal (10.0 %), prostate (7.3%), and stomach (5.6%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18%), followed by colorectal (9.4%), liver (8.3%), stomach (7.7%), and female breast (6.9%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2‐fold to 3‐fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2‐fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64% to 95%) versus transitioned (32% to 56%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.},

   abstract = {In diffusion MRI, spherical deconvolution approaches can estimate local white matter (WM) fiber orientation distributions (FOD) which can be used to produce fiber tractography reconstructions. The applicability of spherical deconvolution to grey matter (GM), however, is still limited, despite its critical role as start/endpoint of WM fiber pathways. The advent of multi-shell diffusion MRI data offers additional contrast to model the GM signal but, to date, only isotropic models have been applied to GM. Evidence from both histology and high-resolution diffusion MRI studies suggests a marked anisotropic character of the diffusion process in GM, which could be exploited to improve the description of the cortical organization. In this study, we investigated whether performing spherical deconvolution with tissue specific models of both WM and GM can improve the characterization of the latter while retaining state-of-the-art performances in WM. To this end, we developed a framework able to simultaneously accommodate multiple anisotropic response functions to estimate multiple, tissue-specific, fiber orientation distributions (mFODs). As proof of principle, we used the diffusion kurtosis imaging model to represent the WM signal, and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model to represent the GM signal. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown with numerical simulations and with data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The performance of our method is compared to the current state of the art, multi-shell constrained spherical deconvolution (MSCSD). The simulations show that with our new method we can accurately estimate a mixture of two FODs at SNR≥50. With HCP data, the proposed method was able to reconstruct both tangentially and radially oriented FODs in GM, and performed comparably well to MSCSD in computing FODs in WM. When performing fiber tractography, the trajectories reconstructed with mFODs reached the cortex with more spatial continuity and for a longer distance as compared to MSCSD and allowed to reconstruct short trajectories tangential to the cortical folding. In conclusion, we demonstrated that our proposed method allows to perform spherical deconvolution of multiple anisotropic response functions, specifically improving the performances of spherical deconvolution in GM tissue.},
